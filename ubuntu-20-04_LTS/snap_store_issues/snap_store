### Issue: Unable to Update "Snap Store" Due to Running Apps

**Problem Description:**
When attempting to update the Snap Store using `snap refresh`, the update process fails with the following error message:
```
Unable to update "Snap Store": cannot refresh "snap-store": snap "snap-store" has running apps (ubuntu-software)
```

**Cause:**
The error occurs because the Snap Store (`snap-store` snap) is currently being used by an application (in this case, `ubuntu-software`), which prevents the snap from being updated.

**Environment:**
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **Architecture:** 64-bit ARM

**Date:** August 22, 2024

**Steps to Resolve:**

1. **Close the Application:**
   - Ensure that all instances of `ubuntu-software` or any other applications using the Snap Store are closed. This can typically be done through the graphical user interface by quitting the application or closing its window.

2. **Stop the Snap Store Snap:**
   - If closing the application does not resolve the issue, manually stop the Snap Store snap by running the following command in the terminal:
     ```bash
     sudo snap stop snap-store
     ```
   - After stopping the snap, attempt the update again with:
     ```bash
     sudo snap refresh snap-store
     ```

3. **(Optional) Check for Running Processes:**
   - If the issue persists, check for any remaining running processes related to the Snap Store and terminate them if necessary:
     ```bash
     ps aux | grep snap-store
     ```
   - Identify the process IDs (PIDs) and stop them using:
     ```bash
     sudo kill -9 <PID>
     ```
   - Replace `<PID>` with the actual process ID.

4. **(Optional) Restart Snap Daemon:**
   - Restarting the Snap daemon can sometimes resolve lingering issues:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart snapd
     ```
   - Then, try updating again.

5. **(Optional) Reboot the System:**
   - If the problem is still unresolved, reboot your system to clear any lingering issues. After rebooting, check for updates:
     ```bash
     sudo snap refresh
     ```

6. **(Optional) Reinstall Snap Store Snap:**
   - As a last resort, you can remove and then reinstall the Snap Store snap:
     ```bash
     sudo snap remove snap-store
     sudo snap install snap-store
     ```

**Additional Notes:**
- Ensure you have the latest version of Snapd installed.
- Closing or stopping the Snap Store snap should be done cautiously to avoid data loss.
